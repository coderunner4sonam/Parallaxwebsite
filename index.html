        The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair and was initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world;

        LThe Tritons and Nereids in the fountains at Place de la Concorde have been there since 1840, in the center of Paris.The two fountains were designed by Jacques Ignace Hittorff, who was commissioned by King Louis-Philippe in 1831 to design the entire Place de la Concorde after Egypt gifted a 230-ton obelisk to France.The project was finished in 1840, with the help of 12 sculptors.   The central figures were created in cast-iron, whereas the 12 triton and mermaid statues (6 in each fountain) were cast in bronze.

        Nicknamed “the most beautiful bridge in the world,” those who have laid eyes on the Pont Alexandre III are generally inclined to agree. The bridge was built between 1896 and 1900 and was named for Tsar Alexander III, the Russian ruler during whose reign the Franco-Russian Alliance was ratified. It was designed in the Beaux-Arts style, and its ornate decorations, especially the Art Nouveau lamps and the huge gilded statues that preside over each side of the bridge, are still a marvel today. The bridge was inaugurated in 1900 in time for the World's Fair, along with nearby neighbors the Grand Palais and Petit Palais.
